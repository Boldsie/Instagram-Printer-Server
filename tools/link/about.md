This lets you create an Instagram 'print' from an Instagram URL
===============================================================

1. Paste Instagram URL
2. You have your print!

####Notes

* The image returned is a base64 encoded jpeg file
* Uses the link.php engine file with format: base64
* You can use short instagram links as well - instagr.am/p/....
* Does not work with private photos - as they require authetification from a user who has privileges to access that photo.
